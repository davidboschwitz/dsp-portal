<h3>Salutations from the Beta Alpha Chapter of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity! Our chapter was started in the spring semester of 2014. Starting with the unwavering support of 45 founding members, this Delta Sig chapter has grown into a prominent organization at Iowa State and continues to expand its presence here on our campus.</h3>

<h3>Within our chapter, you will find several successful and high-achieving men. The range of academic specialties and other campus organizations that our men are involved with embodies the mission of Delta Sigma Phi: to Build Better Men. We strive to represent our chapter to the best of our ability, as well as become better leaders, students, future professionals, and citizens. &nbsp;</h3>
